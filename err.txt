Make sure you have the following format in your workflow file:

on:
issue_comment:
  types:
  - created
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: [your-environment]
    if: (startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '/'))
    steps:
      - name: Comment Command
        id: comment-command
        uses: lowply/comment-command@v1

In the following step, you can use the `command` and `arguments` outputs:

      - name: Checkout PR head
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        if: contains(steps.comment-command.outputs.command, 'deploy')
        with:
          ref: [ref]
